# Dealing with manipulation in Big Data: Second-hand cars industry case study

sed Cars Dataset is about Craigslist which is one of the largest collections of second-hand cars database
Data contains information of used vehicles in United States of America. It can be found in Kaggle (2020).
There are 26 features and 458,213 rows
There are 3 columns with integer data type, 4 columns with float data type and the rest of the 19

I used several regressions to predict the true price of 2nd hand cars.

The regressions used are as follows:
1- OLS
2- Random Forrest
3- Ridge
4- Logistic

Also in this project we used a backward elimination method as a feature engineering tool to improve the quality of our prediction.
